Such experiments give extremely\nlow yields of allophane and the unexpected\nformation of boehmite and amorphous silica\nproduced in this method were noted by Wada et\nal. (1979). In general, amorphous silica and\naluminium hydroxide precipitated first if the\nstarting solutions were were mixed gradually in\nlow concentrations at near-equilibrium conditions\nand the pH was not neutralized gradually with the\nalkaline solution.",
      "It was extremely difficult to\nobtain a high yield of the desired material using\nthe above-mentioned method. In this research, the authors attempted to\nsynthesize allophane in amounts appropriate for\nthe industrial and environmental uses listed above. M A T E R I A L S A N D M E T H O D S\nThe experimental procedure is shown in Fig. 1. Four synthetic allophane products were created,\nfirstly by preparing separate Si-source and Al-\nsource solutions of various concentrations. The\ninitial concentrations of 100, 50, 30 and 10 mmol/l\nof sodium orthosilicate and aluminium chloride\nhexahydrate, respectively, were prepared. The Si-\nand Al-source solutions were weighted at the\natomic ratio of Si/Al = 0. 75 for each initial\nconcentration. Both source solutions were mixed\ntogether rapidly and stirred for 1 h at room\ntemperature to synthesize the allophane precursor. Sodium chloride formed as a by-product in the\nmixed suspension was removed by centrifugation. The white precursors obtained were autoclaved by\nperforming the hydrothermal reaction for 2 days at\n1008C. The resulting materials were washed with\ndistilled water repeatedly until they came to neutral\npH. Subsequently, washed samples were dried at\n408C in an electric oven. Natural allophane (Ki-P)\ntaken from the Kitakami pumice bed was used as a\nreference material. Powder X-ray diffraction measurement was\ncarried out by RINT-2100V/PC diffractometer\n(Rigaku Corp. ) using Ni-filtered Cu-Ka radiation\nat 30 mA and 40 kV. The morphology of the\nproducts was examined using a transmission\nelectron microscope with an accelerating voltage\nof 100 kV (JEM-200CX, JEOL Ltd. ). The Si and Al\ncontents in the products were determined by X-ray\nfluorescence (XRF) analysis using a MESA-500\ndevice (Horiba Ltd). Fourier transform infrared\n(FTIR) spectra were obtained from KBr discs\nincorporating air-dried samples using a Perkin-\nElmer FTIR Spectrum 2000 spectrometer. The\nBrunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the\nproducts was determined by means of nitrogen\nadsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature (T =\n\u00011958C). Pore-size distribution was measured by\nthe Cranston-Inkley method using a nitrogen\nadsorption isotherm (Carlo Erba Instruments Co. ,\nSorptomatic-1900). The isotherm of water vapour\nadsorption was determined using an adsorption\nisotherm analyser (Tokyo Shikenki Manufacturing\nCo. , EAM-01S) using ~0. 3 g of product, which had\nbeen under vacuum at 258C for 1 day. After\ncomplete evacuation, the relative humidity in the\nchamber was gradually increased from 10 to 90%. During this process, the increase in the sample\nweights represented the amount of water vapour\nadsorbed. FIG. 1. Experimental procedure of the synthesis method\nof allophane. 452\nF. Ohashi et al. R E S U L T S A N D D I S C U S S I O N\nFigure 2 shows the XRD profiles of the synthetic\nallophanes. The profiles of the synthetic allophanes\nexhibited broad reflections centred at 0. 34 and\n0. 22 nm, typical of natural allophanes as well as\nX-ray amorphous aluminosilicates. Amongst these\npeaks, is one which is specific to spherical hollow\nparticles\nand\nwhich\noriginates\nin\nthe\nSiO4\ntetrahedral sheet of allophane, especially the\ndiffraction area of 0. 33\u00010. 35 nm. The diffraction\npeak of the silica gel, which consists of the\npolymerized SiO4 tetrahedra, appears nearby at\n~0. 39 nm. Therefore, the allophane has a different\nstructure from that of silica gel (Henmi, 1987). Moreover, the peak that originated in the aluminium\nhydroxides\n(boehmite\nand\ngibbsite)\nwas\nnot\nobserved. The TEM images of typical synthetic\nallophanes are given in Fig. 3. As anticipated,\naggregated ring-shaped particles were observed in\nthe synthesized samples and had structures similar\nto those described for allophanes, which have a\nhollow\nspherical\nstructure\nunit,\nthe\nexternal\ndiameter of which is 3\u00015 nm. In FTIR spectra for\nthe synthetic allophanes, typical absorption bands\nbased on aluminosilicate are clearly observed, i. e.",

An absorption\nband due to the -OH-bending vibration of adsorbed\nwater appeared at 1650 cm\u00011. Wada et al. (1988)\nnoted that natural allophane and imogolite show a\ndistinctive broad absorption centred at 570 cm\u00011\nwith\nweak\nshoulders\nat\n670\nand\n430 cm\u00011,\nsuggesting that the wall structure of the synthesized\na l l o p h a n e s\np o s s e s s\ni m o g o l i t e - t y p e\n((OH)Si(OAloct)3) framework structures. Boehmite\nand gibbsite were recognized, using XRD and\nFTIR, as co-products by Wada et al. (1979) and\nTomura et al. (1996), but were not observed here,\nsuggesting that allophane was synthesized effi-\nciently from higher-concentration solutions, using\nthis method. The pore-size distribution curves of the\nnatural and synthetic allophanes calculated by the\nCranston-Inkley method, are shown in Fig. 5. The\nsynthetic specimens exhibited relatively narrow\nFIG. 2. XRD profiles of the synthetic allophanes from\nsolutions with various initial concentrations. FIG. 3. Typical TEM images of synthetic allophane\n(initial concentration 10 mmol/l). Properties of synthetic allophane\n453\ndistribution curves. The synthetic allophanes have a\nmuch larger peak centred at 4 nm, which results\nfrom a much larger fraction of microporosity\ncompared to the natural allophane. The differential\npore volume within the pore diameter range of\n10\u000130 nm increased as the initial concentration\nwas increased. Though the nitrogen isotherm is not\nshown here, the adsorption isotherm of the synthetic\nallophane showed type I behaviour with an H2\nhysteresis loop. This indicates the presence of\nmicropores; the pore diameter was ~0. 4 nm. This\nvalue corresponds to the size of the accessible open\npores in the allophane spherical wall. These results\nsuggest that the pore distribution of such homo-\ngeneous porous materials can be controlled and\nadjusted using the initial reaction concentrations. The Si/Al ratio analysed by XRF, the specific\nsurface area (BET method), the pore volume and\nthe average pore diameter (C. I. method) of the\nsynthesized samples and the references are listed in\nTable 1. All quantities tended to increase with\nincreasing initial concentration of the starting\nsolution. These remarkably large values of specific\nsurface area and total pore volume are greater than\nthose of natural allophane (265 m2/g, 0. 15 cm3/g). The specific surface area ranged from 490 to\n552 m2/g. The combination of having a high\nsurface area and a relatively narrow pore-size\ndistribution, indicates that most of the surface area\nis probably attributable to the uniform arrangement\nof the internal surfaces. The average pore diameters\nalso increase with initial concentration. The reason\nis the change in the aggregation of the allophane\nparticles. We suggest that the reason for the\nincreasing Si/Al ratio is that 3-D networks were\ndeveloped between the allophane particles, and that\nsynthetic allophane may have excellent adsorption\ncapacity as a consequence. The water vapour\nadsorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 6. The\nsynthetic products exhibited quite distinct adsorp-\ntion-desorption curves which have an inflection\ncharacteristic of capillary condensation within\nopened pores. The adsorption isotherms of the\nsynthetic allophanes showed an isothermal line with\na narrow hysteresis loop. Water molecules were\nadsorbed in type IV isotherms. The small hysteresis\nobserved in those isotherms would be attributed to\nthe capillary condensation phenomenon, because\nthe\nwater\ncontact\nangles\nat\nadsorption\nand\nFIG. 4.

      "The water vapour\nadsorption isotherm of natural allophane showed an\napproximately isothermal line where the amount of\nthe absorbed water increased in a straight line with\nthe increase in the relative water vapour pressure:\nthe maximum amount of absorbed water was\n~30 wt. %. The results indicated that the sample of\ninitial concentration of 100 mmol/l absorbed water\nrapidly by ~0. 8\u00011. 0 relative water vapour pressure\nand showed the hysteresis loop. The maximum\namount of water adsorption achieved was ~85 wt. %\nwhen the relative vapour pressure reached 0. 95. The\ntotal amount of adsorbed water was restricted by\nthe specific surface area and the pore volume. These quantities control the effective surface\navailable for water vapour adsorption. From these\nresults, in order to obtain a large amount of water\nadsorption and high humidity-control ability, it is\nnecessary to control the pore diameter, the BET\nsurface area and the pore volume. Moreover, the\nhumidity control efficiency is better for the\nsynthesized\nproducts\nthan\nfor\nthe\nreference\nmaterials. However, the synthesized materials have\nan associated hysteresis loop. This phenomenon\nmight be due to the difference between condensa-\ntion and evaporation of the liquid water meniscus,\nand/or some of chemically adsorbed water mole-\ncules connected to the Si (or Al) atoms as silanol\n(or aluminol) groups (Iler, 1979). From the above-\nmentioned results, the synthetic allophane might\nbecome a possible intelligent humidity-controlling\nmaterial. Establishing the method of synthesizing\nallophane\nhas\nled\nto\nthe\ndevelopment\nof a\nmultipurpose adsorbent. CONCLUSIONS\nAllophane was synthesized by a hydrothermal\nreaction of inorganic solutions with various higher\ninitial concentrations than was previously thought\npossible. Transmission electron microscopy and\nFTIR spectroscopy revealed that uniform hollow\nspherical aluminosilicate clusters were formed after\nthe hydrothermal synthesis.
